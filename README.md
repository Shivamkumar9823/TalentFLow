TALENT FLOW: A Mini Hiring Platform

TALENT FLOW is a sophisticated front-end React application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a modern HR and candidate management system. It establishes a robust architecture that simulates a full-stack environment entirely within the browser, meeting all technical requirements for persistence, API mocking, and advanced interactions.

Features Implemented

The platform provides complete management over Jobs, Candidates, and Assessments:

1. Jobs Board Management

CRUD & Status: Users can create, edit , and manage the status (Active/Archived) of job postings.
Search & Filtering: Supports filtering by title, status, and tags, with server-like pagination.
Advanced Reordering (D&D): Jobs can be reordered via drag-and-drop with crucial implementation of Optimistic Updates and guaranteed rollback on failure (to handle simulated 500 network errors).
Performance: Search input is implemented with Debouncing to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary API calls.

2. Candidate Pipeline Management
Kanban Board: Candidates are organized and progressed through hiring stages (applied, screen, tech, offer, hired, rejected) using drag-and-drop.
List View: Features a Virtualized list (for 1,000+ candidates) with client-side search (name/email).

Profile Deep Link: A dedicated route (/candidates/:id) shows candidate details and a dynamic Status Timeline.


3. Assessment Builder
Dynamic Builder: Allows adding sections and various question types (single-choice, multi-choice, short/long text, numeric with range, and file upload stub).
Live Preview: Renders the assessment structure as a fillable form in real-time.
Advanced Logic: Supports validation rules (required, numeric range) and conditional questions (e.g., show Q3 only if Q1 is "Yes").



Key Implementation Details
Dual-Mode Data Access: Custom hooks (useJobData, useCandidateData) check process.env.NODE_ENV. The application uses MSW/Fetch in development and directly accesses IndexedDB in production, ensuring stability after deployment (no 404 errors).

Optimistic UI: The Jobs reordering uses optimistic updates for a smoother UX, with explicit rollback logic tied to the mock API's simulated 500 error response.

Data Context: The Candidates Kanban board performs a data lookup (pseudo-join) in the hook to display the correct Job Title and Job ID on every card, providing crucial HR context.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture & Decisions
The application utilizes a sophisticated front-end architecture to simulate the necessary back-end functions:

Layer	Technology	Rationale
Persistence (DB)	IndexedDB via Dexie	
Stores all application data locally. State must be restored from IndexedDB on refresh.

Network Mocking	MSW (Mock Service Worker)	
Intercepts all client fetch calls and directs them to local handlers, providing a simulated REST API environment.

Simulations	Custom Handlers	
Implements artificial latency (200-1200ms) and a 5-10% error rate on write endpoints (POST, PATCH) to test robustness.

List Optimization	react-window (or equivalent)	
Ensures the Virtualized List remains performant when handling the large 1,000+ seeded candidates.
